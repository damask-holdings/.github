# Damask

A 3-developer team overseeing the Damask HR webapp repositories.

The Damask HR project consists of our Angular "Pages" frontend as well as the Django project repository. Each of these two contain additional READMEs for further instructions on project setup on your local machine or cloud server. Therefore, a SQL database connection and webserver are required to host Damask HR properly, which is not contained in the READMEs.

To upload documents separate from the code, please utilize the damask-holdings/.github special repository and send there. 

Further documentation will be provided on how to launch the project easily for demonstrations in a web browser using VS Code.
